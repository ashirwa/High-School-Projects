Here is a short description of all of the projects in this repository. 

Grade Calculator (Java, BBEdit)
A Java application that computes weighted final grades based on four assessment components and their respective percentages. The project emphasizes control flow, input validation, and exception handling to ensure accurate and reliable calculations.

Speed Limit Fine Calculator and Play-Date Distance Calculator (Racket, DrRacket)
Two small Racket programs designed to perform rule based and numerical calculations. These projects focus on conditional logic, variable handling, and applying mathematical reasoning to compute correct outputs.

Right-Angle Triangle Test and ISBN Calculator (Python, Visual Studio Code)
Python programs that evaluate numerical inputs to determine geometric validity and verify ISBN numbers. These projects demonstrate multi value computation, logical checks, and structured problem solving.

LRU Cache (Python, Visual Studio Code)
An implementation of a Least Recently Used cache with a fixed capacity of three key value pairs. This project focuses on data structures, cache eviction strategies, and efficient management of limited resources.
