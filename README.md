Here is a short description of all of the projects in this repository. 

Speeding Fine Project

A small program designed to calculate speeding fines based on user input and predefined rules. This project focused on conditional logic, input validation, and applying real world constraints to produce accurate outputs.

Right Angle Triangle Project

A Python program that determines whether three given values can form a right angle triangle. This project reinforced mathematical logic, condition checking, and structured problem solving using geometric principles.

LRU Cache Project

An implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with a fixed capacity, designed to manage key value pairs efficiently. This project emphasized data structures, cache eviction strategies, and optimizing access patterns in Python.

Grade Calculator Project

A Java based application that calculates weighted grades using multiple assessment components and percentage inputs. This project focused on control flow, error handling, and building reliable calculations with user friendly input validation.
